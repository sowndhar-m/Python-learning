#Array
#arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable. Its a special variable.Which can hold more than one value at a time.
#We can access the values by refering to a indux number.
#Examples 
sports = ["cricket" , "football" , "tennis" , "kabaadi"]
sports.append("Hockey") # a append mentode is useful for add the element to a array
print(sports) #print the varial 
sports.pop(2)
print(sports)
sports.remove("cricket")
print(sports[0]) #access the element
print(len(sports)) #Find the length of the array
x = "football"
#for x in (sports):
# print(x)
#Important : Python does not provide , separate build in array data type  like "C" or "Java".instead, python list can be used to store multiple datas in single variable and its work similary like array.
